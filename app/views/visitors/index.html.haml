    %h1 What Is the #carfreechallenge?
    %p.lead
      Outdoor sports enthusiasts are often also environmentalists. We want to protect the world
      we play in, and part of that is doing what we can to combat climate change.
      Unfortunately, the pursuit of adventure sports often involves a lot of travel,
      both on a large scale -- international trips -- and on a daily basis (your drive to the trailhead).
      Join me in pledging to minimize the carbon impact of our recreation in 2018 by finding adventures
      close to home and using alternative methods of transit!
    %p
      Different sports might require different metrics -- if you're a road biker or sea kayaker,
      you might want to use miles. As a mountain biker, skier, trail runner, and kayaker,
      I'm pledging to gain at least 150,000 feet of elevation without driving my car in 2018.
      Join me by signing up and setting your own goals!

      The simplest way to join is to
      = link_to 'sign up', new_user_registration_path
      here. You can set goals, update progress, see where you stand on the leaderboards, and share with friends.
    %p
      If you're on Strava, we've built an integration so that your activities can be automatically tracked here. You can
      = link_to 'sign up with Strava', user_strava_omniauth_authorize_path
      or link your existing user account later. Then, just mark your carbon neutral activities with the hashtag
      %strong #carfreechallenge
      in either the title or the description and we'll find them automatically and count them here

    %h4 But I live in X...I can't get outside without driving!
    %p.lead
      Fair enough! We can't all live in Jackson (who can afford to anyway!), but I bet there are a lot of
      adventures you can find close to home. We'll be adding some tools for finding local adventures to the website,
      but here are a few ideas to get you started:
      %ul
        %li
          = link_to 'Strava', 'http://www.strava.com'
          has some great tools like heatmaps and flybys to help you find what other adventurers are doing in your area.
          Identify some people who share your passions, follow them, and let them lead you to new places!
        %li
          = link_to 'Instagram.', 'http://www.instagram.com'
          It pains me a little to say this, but Instagram can be a great way to discover new, local spots.
        %li
          = link_to 'Caltopo.', 'http://www.caltopo.com'
          The reality is that nothing beats a good old fashioned map! Caltopo has some great tools for working with maps
          and a number of excellent bases to choose from.
        %li
          = link_to 'GaiaGPS', 'https://www.gaiagps.com'
          is my favorite mobile map application with great topo maps and trails and roads sourced from all over the place.
    %h4 What counts as "car free?"
    %p
      Great question. The short answer is, it's up to you -- this is all voluntary and self-reporting.
      For the purposes of the challenge, I'm saying
      %strong no driving.
      Meaning, you can't drive your car and you can't carpool with a friend. Mass transit is good to go -- you'd be
      surprised what awesome places subways, trains, and busses can get you to!
    %p
      Along those lines, things like gondolas, lifts, etc. are ok, but you can't count them towards your goal.
      In other words, 4 laps off the tram at Jackson is 0' towards the challenge. But if you take the tram up
      and spend your whole day earning turns in Granite Creek, that can count, as long as you didn't
      drive to the mountain!
